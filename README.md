Super WIP for now. Lots of work to do to normalize subreddits with custom designs.

## How to use

#### With userstyle extension

* Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en
* Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/ (be sure to place the CSS inside the `@-moz-document domain("reddit.com")` block)

Copy-pasta the styles from `reddit.css` into a new userstyle in your favorite browser. Be sure to specify that it apply to sites beginning with `https://reddit.com`.
